This is a ros package without any rust code for providing the necessary message and service types.
It will probably be autogenerated in the future. It is needed for the compilation of the voraus-ros-bridge and
all its ros consumers.
As this package will be generated from the OPC UA spec it will move to either the voraus components or to the release
such that a preconfigured rosbridge can be shipped.
